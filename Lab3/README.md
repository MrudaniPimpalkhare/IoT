# Readings and Procedure
## Preparation
### Calibration
Turned the sensor on programmatically and printed values on the Arduino Serial Monitor every 1 second. On tabulating the values and comparing with a scale, we found that the sensor readings have a positive error of 0.58 cm.

### Codes
Prepared before the conduction of the experiment.
